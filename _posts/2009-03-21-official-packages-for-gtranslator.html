<p>The last release of <a href="http://gtranslator.sf.net">gtranslator</a> (1.9.4) has been included in <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> as official package.<br />This is still an unstable release. In the case of Debian, it has been included into Debian Experimental and in Ubuntu has been included in the next stable version, Jaunty.</p>
<p>I would like to say thank you to Debian and Ubuntu people that make this possible. Now, if you are fan of Debian or Ubuntu you can test the new gtranslator installing it from the repository of your favorite GNU/Linux distribution.</p>
