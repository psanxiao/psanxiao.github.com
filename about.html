	About me
</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	I'mm a Libre Software enthusiastic. I've been using GNU/Linux for years. Since early 2007 I've collaborated with GNOME as developer as well as being one of the maintainers of <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator">gtranslator.</a> Due to my work as developer in <a href="http://cartolab.udc.es">CartoLab</a> (University of A Coru√±a) I have specialized in Geographic Information Systems and I have involved in the <a href="http://gvsig.org">gvSIG</a> community as core developer and member of the TSC Board.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	In 2010 I founded a company called <a href="http://icarto.es">iCarto</a> together with several friends, very motivated to create a new job experience based on the collaboration principle and share responsabilities.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	I'm co-founder of a Galician asociation to promote Libre Software, called <a href="http://ghandalf.org">GHANDALF</a> and member of <a href="http://galicia.isf.es">Engineering Without Borders</a>, a Non-governmental development organization.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	When I'm not in front of the computer I like ridding on bike and taking photos. I'm also applicant to triathlete taking part of <a href="http://nosportlimit.com">NoSportLimit</a>.
