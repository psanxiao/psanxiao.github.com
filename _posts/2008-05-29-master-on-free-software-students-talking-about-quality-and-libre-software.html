<p>As activity for one of the subjects in the <a href="http://www.igalia.com/eventos/master/">Master on Free Software</a> we made a paper entitled Quality and Libre Software: a theoretical and practical approach.</p>
<p>In that paper we tried to test the <a href="http://www.openbrr.org/">OpenBRR</a> model. This is an attempt to meassure how much suitable a free software project is when we have a group of requirements. We chose as example in order to test the model in a real case which would be the most appropiate GNU/Linux distribution to an average user.</p>
<p>By means this example we could study the model and discover its strenghs and weakness. In the paper we suggest also some ideas in order to improve it.</p>
<p>Besides, thanks to <a href="http://www.caixanova.com/">Caixanova </a>we could travel to Brussels in order to attend to <a href="http://fosdem.org/2008/">Fosdem</a> and present the paper into the <a href="http://libresoft.es/Activities/Research_activities/fosdem2008">Research Room</a>.</p>
