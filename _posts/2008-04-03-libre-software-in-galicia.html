<p>This week has just published the new number of <a href="http://www.codigocero.com/">Codigocero</a>, a very important galician magazine about technology.  This number is special  for me because there is an interview to Roberto Vieito, one of my classmates in the <a href="http://www.igalia.com/events/master/">Master of  Free Software</a>.  Roberto  made a study about the situation of the Libre Software in Galicia which you can see <a href="https://forge.morfeo-project.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/rvieito/1st-Work/A_study_about_Libre_Software_in_Galician_companies.pdf?rev=109&amp;root=freeswmaster&amp;view=log">here</a> (in English).<br />You can also read the interview <a href="http://codigocero.com/spip.php?article4041">here</a> (in Galician).</p>
<p>Well done Roberto!</p>
