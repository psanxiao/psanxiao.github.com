##About
I’m a Libre Software enthusiastic. I’ve been using GNU/Linux for years. Since early 2007 I’ve collaborated with GNOME as developer as well as being one of the maintainers of [gtranslator](http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator). Due to my work as developer in [CartoLab](http://cartolab.udc.es) (University of A Coruña) I have specialized in Geographic Information Systems and I have involved in the [gvSIG](http://gvsig.org) community as core developer and member of the TSC Board.

In 2010 I founded a company called [iCarto](http://icarto.es) together with several friends, very motivated to create a new job experience based on the collaboration principle and share responsabilities.

I’m co-founder of a Galician asociation to promote Libre Software, called [GHANDALF](http://ghandalf.org) and member of [Engineering Without Borders](http://galicia.isf.es), a Non-governmental development organization.

When I’m not in front of the computer I like ridding on bike and [taking photos](http://flickr.com/psanxiao). I’m also applicant to triathlete taking part of [NoSportLimit](http://nosportlimit.com).
