<p>After reading <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/12/18/the-value-of-typing-code/">this entry</a> it come into my mind a simple question: <strong>Why the first thing that developers do is searching in google when we have to face up to a new problem?</strong></p>
<p>I mean, usually it is a good idea to read code, to see how other people faced up the same problem in order to learn, but, why do not we try to think in a way to resolve the problem before seing other solutions?</p>
<p>Computer Science is older than google, you know ;-)</p>
