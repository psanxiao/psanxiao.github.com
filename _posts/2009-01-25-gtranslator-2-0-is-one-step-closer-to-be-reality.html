<p>Yesterday gtranslator 1.9.4 has been released. This is the first Beta version of gtranslator 2.0. It includes the new features which I talked in a <a href="http://psanxiao.blogspot.com/2008/08/gtranslator-20-is-comming.html">previous post</a>. </p>
<p>I want to say thank you to all the people that have contributed with the project somehow.</p>
<p>You can download it from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtranslator">here</a> and test it.</p>
<p>I would be happy if gtranslator makes your work a bit easier.</p>
