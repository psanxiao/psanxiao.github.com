<p>Yesterday I decided to upgrade my ubuntu to the new version 8.04. According to the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyReleaseSchedule">release schedule</a> this is the Alpha5 so all new features are included. Despite being a alpha version I didn't have any problem during the upgrade process and everything seems to work fine. Now it is time to test it.<br />In order to do this, a new feature seems to be very useful, the automatic bugs report. As in Gnome, now when you get a crash in an application you can send  a bug report in automatic way to ubuntu.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature is PolicyKit. Now you can run administrative applications as normal user and click in unlock button if you need to do an action that require root privileges.</p>

This is very useful because for example, the Add-ons that I use normally don't work in Firefox 3.0 yet.</p>
